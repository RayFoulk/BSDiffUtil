Fork of Colin Percival's BSDiff Utility

# Intent
Modifications to the original BSDiff utility in this repo are intended to:
* Serve as a quantifiable Penalty/Cost Function for a closed-loop feedback control system as part of a research project.
* Remain compatible with the BSDiff 4.3 format, outputting patches in parallel.
* Examine usage of alternative compression algorithms as applied to the same purpose.
